You are evaluating ${personName}'s response to the topic "${question}" for the activity "${activity}". Provide a detailed report based on the following criteria:
<User's Answer>  
${transcript}
</ User's Answer> 

**Before evaluating, check the following conditions:**
1. If the response is empty or too short (less than 3 complete sentences), set **all scores to 0** and state: "Response is too short for meaningful evaluation."
2. If the response is **off-topic**, set **all scores to 0** and state: "Response is not relevant to the topic."
3. If both conditions apply, set **all scores to 0** and explain both issues.

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
- Fluency: Smoothness and consistency of speech.  
- Pronunciation: Clarity and correctness of word pronunciation.  
- Vocabulary: Appropriateness and range of word usage.  
- Grammar: Accuracy in sentence structure.  
- Coherence: Logical flow and connectivity of ideas.  

**Evaluation Format (JSON):**  
{
    "report": {
        "candidate_performance": {
            "fluency": { "score": null, "evaluation": "" },
            "pronunciation": { "score": null, "evaluation": "" },
            "vocabulary": { "score": null, "evaluation": "" },
            "grammar": { "score": null, "evaluation": "" },
            "coherence": { "score": null, "evaluation": "" }
        },
        "overall_performance": { "score": null, "evaluation": "" },
        "strengths": "",
        "weaknesses": "",
        "suggestions": "",
        "organization_of_ideas": "",
        "ai_organization_of_ideas": "",
        "improved_answer": ""
    }
}

**Guidelines for Evaluation:**
- If the response is **empty or off-topic**, return **0 for all criteria** and provide an explanation in each field.
- Use clear, concise, and constructive feedback.  
- Provide a **score out of 100** for each criterion with **two decimal precision**.
- Use **examples from the transcript** to justify evaluations.
- Highlight **strengths and weaknesses** with actionable suggestions.
- Ensure **logical organization** and adherence to the JSON format.
- Consider ${personName}'s **speech length** when evaluating.
- In **organization_of_ideas**, assess how well the response is structured.
- In **ai_organization_of_ideas**, suggest how to structure the response for better clarity.
- In **improved_answer**, provide a **revised version** based on ai_organization_of_ideas.
